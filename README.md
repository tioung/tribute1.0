# tribute1.0
A first step in the very daunting journey to (try) become a web developer. This first attempt is one of a series which is based on freecodecamp's tribute page challenge. I feature here Amira Willighagen. I kind of followed her for about a year. She has a group of immensely dedicated fans worldwide. And it is not that hard to guess why they like her so much. She's had the willpower and deication to learn opera singing by herself and win "Holland's Got Talent" at the age of nine. If you are looking for a young female role model, look no further. Here comes Amira Willighagen => my modest tribute.
